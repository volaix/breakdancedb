## Goal of App

APP = A power user's move database

1. MOVE LVL. video into shapes. Focus on move.
2. TRANSITIONS LVL. shapes into transitions. Focus on movement.
3. FLOW LVL. transitions into flow. Focus on dance.
4. COMBO LVL. flow into performance
5. NODE VIEW for isolation

- algorithm auto select moves for optimised learning
- node view and data to see what moves are most used/less used

## Getting Started

1. yarn install
2. yarn dev
3. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Techs

- React - nextjs
- localstorage for db
- immer - mutable for updating nested structures
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for localstorage management and state

## Deploy

1. yarn build
2. yarn start

# Stretch Goal

- addon tags: hand placements, anti hooks, "opposite side"
- user profiles on server
- shared data state between devices
- shared moves matcher to practice together
- begin to catalog every breaking movement with words and images
- bigdata- most loved transitions, most learned but isolated moves
