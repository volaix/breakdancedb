## Goal of App

APP = A power user's move database

Roadmap: https://trello.com/invite/b/io1dH18G/ATTI3b20ecf6d8200e4485972068f0d98e1aD9E2704F/dev-roadmap

1. MOVE LVL. video into shapes. Focus on move.
2. TRANSITIONS LVL. shapes into transitions. Focus on movement.
3. FLOW LVL. transitions into flow. Focus on dance.
4. COMBO LVL. flow into performance
5. NODE VIEW for isolation

- algorithm auto select moves for optimised learning
- node view and data to see what moves are most used/less used

## Getting Started

1. yarn install
2. yarn dev
3. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Doing PRs

- "yarn format" to check prettier
- "yarn format:fix" to autofix
- "yarn ts" for fixing ts errors
- "yarn lint" for fixing linter errors
- Vercel accepts deployment in PR branch - has weird stuff that linter doesnt find
- Check for conflicts - "git merge main"

## Stack

- React - nextjs
- localstorage for db
- Tailwind CSS
- State management is not set. Zustand is installed but not currently used.

## Deploy

1. yarn build
2. yarn start

# Stretch Goal

- addon tags: hand placements, anti hooks, "opposite side"
- user profiles on server
- shared data state between devices
- shared moves matcher to practice together
- begin to catalog every breaking movement with words and images
- bigdata- most loved transitions, most learned but isolated moves
