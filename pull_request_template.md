### What I did in this PR:

I'm too lazy to write something.

### How did I do it?

I already wrote it above.

### Tests done:

I didn't do any.

### Checklist for opinionated, typed, linted, deployed, and mergable code.

`yarn ok` to test all the boxes 📦

- "yarn format" to check prettier 🔍
- "yarn format:fix" to autofix 💃
- "yarn ts" for fixing ts errors 🎉
- "yarn lint" for fixing linter errors 🫢

- Vercel accepts deployment in PR branch - has weird stuff that linter doesnt find 🏛️
- Check for conflicts - possibly need to "git merge main" or similar

Great! I passed all the tests!
